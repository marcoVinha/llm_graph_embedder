      "/home/marcovinha/llm_graph_embedder/.venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages/ogb/nodeproppred/dataset.py:70: FutureWarning: You are using `torch.load` with `weights_only=False` (the current default value), which uses the default pickle module implicitly. It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.\n",

Like previous learned approaches to language generation, our model uses a simple feature-driven architecture (here a pair of neural \"listener\" and \"speaker\" models) to ground language in the world. Like inference-driven approaches to pragmatics, our model actively reasons about listener behavior when selecting utterances. For training, our approach requires only ordinary captions, annotated _without_ demonstration of the pragmatic behavior the model ultimately exhibits. In human evaluations on a referring expression game, our approach succeeds 81% of the time, compared to a 69% success rate using existing techniques. \\n Title: reasoning about pragmatics with neural listeners and speakers \\n Question: Which arXiv CS sub-category does this paper belong to?

In this paper, we propose a logical characterization of bisimulation metrics based on a simple probabilistic variant of the Hennessy-Milner logic. Our approach is based on the novel notions of mimicking formulae and distance between formulae. The former are a weak version of the well known characteristic formulae and allow us to characterize also (ready) probabilistic simulation and probabilistic bisimilarity. The latter is a 1-bounded pseudometric on formulae that mirrors the Hausdorff and Kantorovich lifting the defining bisimilarity pseudometric. We show that the distance between two processes equals the distance between their own mimicking formulae. \\n Title: logical characterization of bisimulation metrics \\n Question: Which arXiv CS sub-category does this paper belong to?

Moreover, we also propose an adaptive padding mechanism to automatically choose the optimal padding strategy for each region, which directly increases the overall system performance.

Furthermore, we extend QBF calculi by the possibility to instantiate a universal variable by an existential variable of smaller level. Combining such an enhanced calculus with the propositional extension rule results in a calculus with a universal quantifier rule which essentially introduces propositional formulas for universal variables. In this way, one can mimic a very general quantifier rule known from sequent systems. \\n Title: on stronger calculi for qbfs \\n Question: Which arXiv CS sub-category does this paper belong to?

However, run time monitoring of contracts imposes a significant overhead. The execution time is impacted by the insertion of contract checks as well as by the introduction of proxy objects that perform delayed contract checks on demand. #R##N#Static contract simplification attacks this issue using program transformation. It applies compile-time transformations to programs with contracts to reduce the overall run time while preserving the original behavior. Our key technique is to statically propagate contracts through the program and to evaluate and merge contracts where possible. The goal is to obtain residual contracts that are collectively cheaper to check at run time. We distinguish different levels of preservation of behavior, which impose different limitations on the admissible transformations: Strong blame preservation, where the transformation is a behavioral equivalence, and weak blame preservation, where the transformed program is equivalent up to the particular violation reported. Our transformations never increase the overall number of contract checks. \\n Title: static contract simplification \\n Question: Which arXiv CS sub-category does this paper belong to?

Data slicing can be realized as a program transformation that partitions heaps of machines in a hierarchy into independent regions. Inside each region of each machine, pointers preserve the original pointer structures in the original heap hierarchy. Each heap component of the base type (e.g., the integer type) goes only to a region of one of the heaps. The proposed technique has the shape of a system of inference rules. In addition, this paper presents a simply structure type system to decide type soundness of distributed programs. Using this type system, a mathematical proof that the proposed slicing technique preserves typing properties is outlined in this paper as well. \\n Title: distributed data and programs slicing \\n Question: Which arXiv CS sub-category does this paper belong to?

This slows down their convergence because hypotheses drawn from a minimal set of noisy inliers can deviate significantly from the optimal model. This work addresses this problem by introducing ANSAC, a RANSAC-based estimator that accounts for noise by adaptively using more than the minimal number of correspondences required to generate a hypothesis. ANSAC estimates the inlier ratio (the fraction of correct correspondences) of several ranked subsets of candidate correspondences and generates hypotheses from them. Its hypothesis-generation mechanism prioritizes the use of subsets with high inlier ratio to generate high-quality hypotheses. ANSAC uses an early termination criterion that keeps track of the inlier ratio history and terminates when it has not changed significantly for a period of time. The experiments show that ANSAC finds good homography and fundamental matrix estimates in a few iterations, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods. \\n Title: ansac adaptive non minimal sample and consensus \\n Question: Which arXiv CS sub-category does this paper belong to?

Specifically, we consider quantum proofs for properties of black-box groups, which are finite groups whose elements are encoded as strings of a given length and whose group operations are performed by a group oracle. We prove that for an arbitrary group oracle there exist succinct (polynomial-length) quantum proofs for the Group Non-Membership problem that can be checked with small error in polynomial time on a quantum computer. Classically this is impossible--it is proved that there exists a group oracle relative to which this problem does not have succinct proofs that can be checked classically with bounded error in polynomial time (i.e., the problem is not in MA relative to the group oracle constructed). By considering a certain subproblem of the Group Non-Membership problem we obtain a simple proof that there exists an oracle relative to which BQP is not contained in MA. Finally, we show that quantum proofs for non-membership and classical proofs for various other group properties can be combined to yield succinct quantum proofs for other group properties not having succinct proofs in the classical setting, such as verifying that a number divides the order of a group and verifying that a group is not a simple group. \\n Title: succinct quantum proofs for properties of finite groups \\n Question: Which arXiv CS sub-category does this paper belong to?

It has been shown that sampling from the space of node orders yields better results [FK03, EW06]. Recently, Koivisto and Sood showed how one can analytically marginalize over orders using dynamic programming (DP) [KS04, Koi06]. Their method computes the exact marginal posterior edge probabilities, thus avoiding the need for MCMC. Unfortunately, there are four drawbacks to the DP technique: it can only use modular priors, it can only compute posteriors over modular features, it is difficult to compute a predictive density, and it takes exponential time and space. We show how to overcome the first three of these problems by using the DP algorithm as a proposal distribution for MCMC in DAG space. We show that this hybrid technique converges to the posterior faster than other methods, resulting in more accurate structure learning and higher predictive likelihoods on test data. \\n Title: bayesian structure learning using dynamic programming and mcmc \\n Question: Which arXiv CS sub-category does this paper belong to?
